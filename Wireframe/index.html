        <h2 id ="wire1">Wireframe</h2>
        <p>A wireframe is a simple line diagram representing the skeleton of a website or an application's user interface (UI) and core functionality.
          It shows where components should be in relation to each other and what, roughly, they should do.

        <h2 id = "readme">The Purpose of A README file</h2>
        <p>
          A README file is a text document that provides essential information about a project, software, or repository. 
          It typically includes details such as the purpose of the project, installation instructions, usage guidelines,
          dependencies, and any other relevant notes that help users and contributors understand the software.
          README files are commonly found in code repositories and often use the .md (Markdown) or format.

        <h2 id = "git">What is a branch in Git</h2>
        <p>A branch in Git is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. Branches are used to create independent development lines, 
           allowing changes to be made without affecting other parts of a repository. 
           The default branch in a repository is typically called main or master, but additional branches can be created for new features, bug fixes, or experiments.
